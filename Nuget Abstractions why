The NuGet package `Microsoft.Extensions.Logging.Abstractions` provides a simplified and more lightweight version of `Microsoft.Extensions.Logging`. Hereâ€™s why you might need it over (or in addition to) the main `Microsoft.Extensions.Logging` package:

1. **Dependency Injection and Abstraction Layer**: `Microsoft.Extensions.Logging.Abstractions` contains basic interfaces, like `ILogger` and `ILoggerFactory`, which are often needed when you only want to reference logging contracts (without pulling in the entire logging implementation). This is useful in cases where your project depends on an external library that only requires these interfaces for logging, rather than the whole logging framework.

2. **Reduced Footprint**: `Microsoft.Extensions.Logging.Abstractions` is smaller in size and contains only the core logging interfaces and essential no-op implementations (e.g., `NullLogger`). This is often preferable for projects with strict size or dependency limitations, like those used in microservices, libraries, or lightweight applications.

3. **Separation of Concerns**: By using `Microsoft.Extensions.Logging.Abstractions`, you decouple your logging interface dependencies from the actual implementation. This separation helps in dependency injection scenarios, making it easier to mock or substitute logging functionality, especially in unit tests.

4. **Compatibility with Different Frameworks**: If you're developing a library intended for a broad audience, referencing only `Microsoft.Extensions.Logging.Abstractions` ensures that consumers can use the logging system they prefer without forcing them to add the full `Microsoft.Extensions.Logging` package.

In general, use `Microsoft.Extensions.Logging.Abstractions` if you only need logging interfaces for contracts or testing, and add `Microsoft.Extensions.Logging` if you need the full logging functionality.
