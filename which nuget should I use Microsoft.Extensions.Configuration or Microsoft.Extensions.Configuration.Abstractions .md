Whether to use `Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration` or `Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration.Abstractions` depends on your project’s requirements:

1. **Use `Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration.Abstractions`**:
   - This package provides only the **basic configuration interfaces** (`IConfiguration`, `IConfigurationSection`, etc.) and **minimal abstractions**. 
   - It’s suitable if you’re building **libraries or projects** that need to depend on configuration interfaces but **don’t require specific configuration providers** (like JSON, environment variables, or command-line arguments).
   - It keeps dependencies **lightweight**. For instance, if you’re creating a shared library that will be used across different applications, using the `Abstractions` package allows consumers of your library to decide how they want to configure the full configuration.

2. **Use `Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration`**:
   - This package includes everything in `Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration.Abstractions` plus **core configuration functionality** and support for **basic configuration providers**.
   - Use it if your project directly needs configuration loading functionality and default providers, such as **environment variables, in-memory collections**, etc.
   - In a typical application (like an ASP.NET Core app), `Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration` is usually what you want, as it supports both the abstraction and the **actual functionality to configure the app** with different sources.

### Practical Usage Example
- **Library**: Use `Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration.Abstractions` if you only need configuration interfaces and want to keep your library’s dependencies minimal.
- **Application**: Use `Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration` if you need to handle actual configuration loading and management, like reading from JSON or environment variables.

In short, `Abstractions` is more suitable for lightweight dependencies, while `Configuration` is needed for actual configuration handling in applications.
